    <h1>This is how we structure a web-page !</h1>
    <p>
      Structuring a web-page is very important as it helps us to make pages
      looks better and also easy to maintain. While designing a web-page we can
      also consider semantics of the page's content so that the pages become
      more accessible and can be interpreted by wider audience.
