        <p>We can create multiple layers of style in the same origin which helps to organise the styling in structured way and also avoids the problem of <em>specifity</em> as the new layers has precedance over the previous layers. </p>

                <h2>Defining Layers</h2>
                <p>There are 3 ways of defing the layers in CSS.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>@layer statement at-rule, where we declare the layer names. It has no style body.</li>
                    <li>@layer block at-rule, styles are defined in the block.</li>
                    <li>@import rule with the <strong>layer</strong> keyword which can assign external sheets as a <em>CSS</em> layer.</li>
                </ul>
