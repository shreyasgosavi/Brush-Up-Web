    <h2>Why is it necessary ?</h2>
    <p>
      Structuring a web-page is very important as it helps us to make pages
      looks better and also easy to maintain. While designing a web-page we can
      also consider semantics of the page's content so that the pages become
      more <em>accessible</em> and can be interpreted by wider audience.
