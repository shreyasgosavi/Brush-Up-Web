      <h1>Pseudo Selector</h1>
      <p>
        We can get HTML elements of the page in different ways, one such way is
        using the <em>Pseudo-selectors.</em>
      </p>

      <p>There are two types of pseudo-selectors :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudo Class</li>
        <li>Pseudo Elements</li>
      </ul>
    </header>

    <main>
      <article id="pseudo-class">
        <header>
            <h2>Pseudo Class :</h2>
            <p>
            This selectors are used to select the elements based on the state of
            the element. After selecting the element it adds the styling property
            to those elements, behavior is like adding a class to the elements but
            using <em>pseudo-class</em> makes the code more maintainable.
